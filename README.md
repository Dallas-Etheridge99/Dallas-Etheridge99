- 👋 Hi, I’m @Dallas-Etheridge99
- 👀 I’m interested in creating indie games independently or even with a group if I'm the right fit.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to program in C# and 2d/3d art.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on an indie game. I'm a beginner at code and have no experience in art yet, but I am a musician so I could write a soundtrack to a game as soon as today! 
- 📫 How to reach me: Email: dallas.etheridge99@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have a black cat named Oliver. He's a beaut.
